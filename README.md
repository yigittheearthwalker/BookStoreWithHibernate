# BookStoreWithHibernate
 
 A reinterpretation of my previous example BookStoreWithJDBC
 
 It covers persist and get opertions for three entities that are inherited from one MappedSuperclass
 
 It also has a CustomIDGenerator util class that assign's an ID based on the type of the subclass using @GenericGenerator annotation
